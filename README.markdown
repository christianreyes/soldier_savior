#Soldier Savior

A six wheeled autonomous vehicle which will be able to follow a soldier and respond to the soldier being injured. 

When the soldier's vitals indicate danger, the vehicle will use its robotic arm to autonomously deliver supplies. Additionally, the vehicle and arm will be able to be controlled manually via a RC transmitter.
